# smartcab

- The goal of this project is to train a smartcab to drive itself safely by following the traffic rules and to reach its destination on time.
- The purpose of this project is to use reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a smartcab operating in real-time to prove that both safety and efficiency can be achieved.
- I successfully implemented the smartcab project using Reinforcement Techniques by using reward-penalty systems from Q-Learning equation and update a table accordingly. As the smartcab explores the city, it becomes better and better at choosing actions and safely reaching its destinations on time.
- After reading this project you should understand how to use Bellman equation in Python to construct modules necessary for a successful self driving Agent. 


### Install

- This project requires Python 2.7 with the pygame library installed

### Run

- In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory smartcab/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

python robot_motion_planning/agent.py
or
python -m robot_motion_planning.agent

This will run the agent.py file and execute your agent code.
